## 🌟 About Me

I'm passionate about bridging computer science and GIScience with the built environment. My research explores how emerging technologies can shape smarter, more comfortable cities.  
Here’s what drives me:

- **Urban Intelligence**: Harnessing IoT & AI for city innovation  
- **Urban Data**: Analyzing multi-source urban data for real-world impact  
- **Urban Comfort**: Centering human experience in urban design  
- **Architectural Systems**: Rethinking buildings for sustainability & intelligence

I am also actively exploring cutting-edge computational methods to advance urban science:
- **Foundation Models**: Leveraging large language and vision models for geospatial reasoning
- **World Models**: Learning dynamic representations of urban systems for predictive understanding
- **Reinforcement Learning**: Enabling adaptive and optimized urban decision-making
- **Spatiotemporal Modeling**: Capturing complex geographic patterns across scales and time
