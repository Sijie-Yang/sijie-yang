## 🌟 About Me

I'm passionate about bridging computer science and GIScience with the built environment. My research explores how emerging technologies can shape smarter, more comfortable cities.  
Here’s what drives me:

- **Urban Intelligence**: Harnessing IoT & AI for city innovation  
- **Urban Data**: Analyzing multi-source urban data for real-world impact  
- **Urban Comfort**: Centering human experience in urban design  
- **Architectural Systems**: Rethinking buildings for sustainability & intelligence

In my recent work, I focus on leveraging **foundation models** (large language & vision models), **world models**, **reinforcement learning**, and **advanced spatiotemporal modeling** to build next-generation urban analytics frameworks. These approaches aim to capture the complexity of urban systems, support dynamic decision-making, and advance human-centered, intelligent city design.
